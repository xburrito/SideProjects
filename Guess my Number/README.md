### Project Description

This small program plays the "GUESS MY NUMBER" game. A randomly generated number will assigned by the program. As the user, our goal is to guess that number. If the number is guess wrong, the program will tell you and hint whether the actual number is higher or lower than your guess.

At the end, once you guessed correctly, the program will display how many guesses you took to get it right as well as whether or not you want to play again. Else, it will end the program :D
